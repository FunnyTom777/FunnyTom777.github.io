<h1>X700-800-900VM</h1>
<p><strong>A retro-modern virtual console experience by WoofTech.</strong> X700VM simulates the WoofTech X700 system—play media, launch games, and explore a custom interface built with HTML/CSS/JS. Fully offline, customizable, and open-source. Console feel, PC freedom.</p>

<h2>About the X700</h2>
<p> 
The x700 is a media and gaming console made by WoofTech. It uses standard PC hardware but runs a custom virtual machine (x700vm) that emulates or simulates the x700 console experience. The x700vm is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It acts like a custom fullscreen interface, kind of like Steam Big Picture Mode mixed with an old-school console OS. It doesn't use a full operating system itself — it's just a browser-based or Electron-based app that simulates the interface and functions of the x700.

The base OS running underneath could be something like Ubuntu or any Linux distro. The VM app would launch on startup to make the device feel like a real console. The x700 has two modes: media mode (for playing DVDs, Blu-rays, and WoofTech’s custom WPDS discs), and steam mode (which is a WIP and would support launching games using Steam or other launchers).

<h2>Models</h2>
<pre>
x700: base model with basic PC hardware
x800: mid-tier with stronger hardware
x900: high-end version with powerful hardware, triple GPU setup (rebranded AMD cards called Barkclass), more RAM, more power
</pre>

<h2>WPDS & WWBC Mega-Drive</h2>
<p>
The WPDS system is a custom disc format made by WoofTech that can hold movies, games, and software. Games require a WPDS disc and a license cart inserted to play. Everything is fully offline, no internet needed.

There's also a system called WWBC Mega-Drive which lets you stream WoofWorks content by plugging in a special drive that holds media offline.
</p>

<h2>Open Source & Customization</h2>
<p>
The x700vm is open-source and can be run on any PC or device, making it easy for people to simulate the x700 experience anywhere. Users can make their own themed VMs or customize the base one.

Eventually the whole platform can support custom games, WoofTech branding, Steam integration, and unique hardware/software features for a retro-modern hybrid console experience.
