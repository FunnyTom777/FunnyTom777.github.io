## Introduction: An Opening Thought With No Plan

There’s something strange and oddly satisfying about diving headfirst into a project with absolutely no plan, no timeline, and often no clear end goal. For some people, that sounds like a nightmare. For me, that’s just a regular Tuesday. I’ve always found myself juggling dozens of ideas at once, ranging from grand-scale open-world driving games to tiny, ridiculous gadgets that maybe only I would use — but somehow, all of it makes sense in my head. This isn't a showcase. It's not a neat portfolio. It’s more like dumping out an entire drawer full of thoughts and inviting someone to sift through it all with me. So grab a comfy seat. This might take a while.

## A Never-Ending List of Projects

### MTT — A Game With Too Many Features

Let’s start with what might be the most ambitious of all: **Milk🥛, Toast🍞, TACO!🌮** (also known as MTT). It began as a simple driving sim idea and quickly spiraled into a full-blown franchise in my head. Not just a game — a series. A whole ecosystem of driving, building, exploring, digging, and restoring.

It’s like if you took *Forza Horizon*, added in construction tools, freeform building, terrain deformation, and a pet system, then gave players the ability to fly planes, drive trains, dig massive trenches with excavators, and rebuild war-torn cities in Story Mode. That’s MTT.

There’s a career mode where you climb the ranks, starting from nothing but a rusty van. There’s a sandbox mode with full mod support and 100,000 square kilometer maps. And of course, I’ve designed a system where map files can be streamed from servers, so friends don’t need to download 80GB of terrain just to join your game. That’s right. Thinking *ahead*.

Somehow, it still doesn’t feel like enough.

### Quantum OS & the QIIEI ACS — Why Not Build an Entire Operating System?

Why stop at games when you can also build the machine to run them? I started designing the **QIIEI Advanced Compute System (ACS)**, a computer that breaks away from the generic beige boxes and instead feels like a piece of gear from a cyberpunk future. It runs **Quantum OS**, which I envisioned as everything Windows *should* have been — fast, ad-free, fully customizable, and not bloated with nonsense.

I wanted something that could boot into a clean Linux desktop that looks like Windows 10, but with absolutely none of the telemetry or ads. Something built from the ground up for creative chaos. Whether you're making games, coding, or wiring up a strange radio interface to broadcast across your house, this thing would run it all. It's hardware for people like me — who open ten terminals just to check the weather.

### The THING™️ — Physical Meets Digital

At some point, I decided trading cards weren’t interactive enough. Enter the **THING™️** — a handheld device that merges real-world collectible cards with digital gameplay. Insert a cartridge, plug in a physical card with a QR code on the back, and bam — the device knows what it is. You can battle, level up your cards, and even link up with another person using a retro cable for trades.

It’s part *Pokémon*, part *Digimon*, part *Game Boy Advance*, and a whole lot of chaos. Not built for mass appeal. Built because I wanted it to exist.

## Barkipelago, Doggy Wars, and Worldbuilding for No Reason

### The Doggy Universe

This might be one of the strangest and most expansive things I’ve ever made up. A whole universe built around dogs — and not in a cutesy, animated way. This is geopolitical, military, economic, and cultural worldbuilding. The **United Nations of Dog (UND)** is the dominant world superpower. They’ve got manufacturing that dwarfs any real-world country, a navy that spans the oceans, and a sprawling military-industrial complex built by a company called **WoofWorks**. I created this world so deeply that it started bleeding into other ideas.

There are entire wars, like **The Great Doggy War**, which unfolds with real military tactics — lots of aircraft carriers and sound trucks. less of the traditional story and more focused on huge mechanized battles. And in this same world, on the edges of civilization, is **Barkipelago Adventures** — a gentler, more exploratory journey where a few pups travel the ocean in a tiny fishing boat, discovering islands, meeting odd characters, and slowly uncovering the forgotten history of their world.

These stories don’t have an end yet. But they have *momentum*, and that’s something.

## Things That Exist for No Reason

### BarkWorksTransceiver900

Because apparently I needed to make a themed radio player for myself — one with green text on a black screen, like a forgotten computer terminal. It doesn’t just play music. It feels like something out of a secret bunker. There’s a magic in making tech feel tactile again, even if it’s all just stylized HTML and Tailwind CSS. Sometimes, the function doesn’t even matter. It’s just about the *vibe*.

### The Fleet That Never Stops Growing

At some point I decided that WoofWorks — the megacorporation that fuels the UND — needed its own *fleet*. And not just any fleet. I’m talking 1000s of vehicles. Massive sound trucks. Blacked-out Ford Falcons. GMCs bristling with antennas and sensors. Cargo ships. Patrol boats. VTOLs. If it moves, I’ve imagined a WoofWorks version of it, optimized for maximum coolness and/or overwhelming force.

I didn’t build them physically (yet), but I’ve drafted their specs, designed their loadouts, and written lore about where they’re deployed. Some people collect stamps. I design imaginary convoys.

## The Loop: Too Many Ideas, Not Enough Time

Here’s where things get complicated. I always have ideas. Dozens. Hundreds. I’m not short on creativity. What I often run out of is motivation. I’ll sit in front of a blank file, knowing I want to build something, knowing I’ve got plans for half a dozen games, tools, or OS-level utilities, and yet… nothing gets done.

I might wander off. Open a new tab. Start another project. Switch to something completely unrelated. And then I’m stuck in this mental loop — too many ideas, no energy to chase them, but somehow still dreaming up *more*.

It’s frustrating. But it’s also part of the process. There’s beauty in the chaos.

## Why I Keep Going

I don’t always finish what I start. I rarely build something exactly as planned. But that’s okay. The act of *starting* is where I find the fun. The moment I sit down and sketch out a weird UI, or piece together how a fictional army might build its vehicles, or wire up a Linux box with a dozen dev tools...

I might not have a polished portfolio. I might not release half the stuff I dream up. But this ongoing creative storm inside my head? It never really stops. And maybe that’s the point.

It’s all about making something hahah.

## Closing Thoughts With No Real Conclusion

This wasn’t a blog post with a message. It’s not a tutorial or a product pitch. It’s more like a long walk through my creative brain — the shelves, the crates, the junk piles, the glowing ideas that haven’t quite formed yet. And if you’ve made it this far, well… thanks. That means something.

I’m probably already working on the next bizarre thing. Or thinking about it. Or abandoning one project to start five more. But I wouldn’t have it any other way.
